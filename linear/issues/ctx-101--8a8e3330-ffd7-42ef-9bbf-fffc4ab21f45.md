# CTX-101: Can't connect Github during onboarding flow

The GitHub app pops up for me to select repos, but the callback just resets the 'Connect GitHub page' to say 'Connect Github'. I've tried a dozen times and it's caught in a loop.

Connect Github -> Opens select org popup -> Select repo(s) -> Return to ctx| -> 'Connect Github'

This is an issue in preview branches only, despite callback in the Github app. It works in prod.

[**Github onboarding connection**](<https://www.cursor.com/agents/bc-1de10d61-deb6-40f4-a2b7-f197609f5c76>)

## Diagnosis

The loop was not random OAuth flakiness. Two separate failures stacked:

1. **Backend resolution** — Self-hosted setup can leave draft/placeholder `connections` rows. After a successful GitHub App install, an org could have both a **linked** row (`installationId` set) and **draft** rows. `resolveGithubInstallationForOrgDetailed` treated *any* multiple rows as ambiguous, so `GET /github/installation` returned **400**. The UI query failed and onboarding stayed on “Connect GitHub” even though registration had worked. That fits “tried a dozen times” (more draft rows, still ambiguous).
2. **Popup callback timing** — The callback wrote `installation_id` to `localStorage` in `useEffect` then closed. The opener could read storage **before** the write finished → `no_result` → silent reset with no error message.

## Fix (PR #196)

Draft PR: [https://github.com/ctxpipe-ai/ctxpipe/pull/196](<https://github.com/ctxpipe-ai/ctxpipe/pull/196>)

| Area | Change |
| -- | -- |
| **Backend** | `resolveGithubInstallationFromList` prefers rows with `installationId`; ambiguous only when multiple *linked* or multiple *unlinked* rows |
| **Popup** | Synchronous `localStorage` write, `sessionStorage` popup marker, short poll before opener registers |
| **UI** | `isGithubInstallationLinked()` — “connected” only when `installationId` is set |

## Tests added

* `apps/backend/src/models/github-installation.resolve.test.ts`
* Updated `githubConnectFlow.test.ts`

## Skeptical note

If someone’s GitHub App **Setup URL** points at the wrong host (not their `AUTH_BASE_URL`), they can still loop — that’s configuration, not this code path. Worth confirming Setup URL matches the deployment origin for self-hosted installs.

Manual check: onboarding → Connect GitHub → finish install in popup → step should advance or show connected, including when a draft connector row already exists from an aborted self-hosted wizard.
