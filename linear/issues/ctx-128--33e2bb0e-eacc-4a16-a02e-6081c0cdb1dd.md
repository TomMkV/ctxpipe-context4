# CTX-128: Close learning loop

We need to enable the trickling down to agent learnings to other agents.

@jakub this needs better definition - I don't fully understand where the loop gaps are.

1. Agents pull from the graph via the ctx_advisor MCP
2. Agent can create memories via the local memory skill and hooks
3. These memories are committed and in the PR
4. Agents pull these down and benefit from it? 

What am I missing?
