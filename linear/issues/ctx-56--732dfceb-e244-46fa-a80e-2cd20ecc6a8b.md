# CTX-56: Design and implement first-pass pricing page + Polar billing model

**Summary**
We need a first-pass pricing model and pricing page for **ctxpipe.ai** that reflects the product as **organisation-level engineering context infrastructure**, not a simple seat-based SaaS tool.

The commercial model should be:

* **base subscription per organisation**
* **included usage allowance**
* **usage-based expansion**
* **enterprise/custom deployment tier**

This aligns better with how ctxpipe creates value and incurs cost: ingestion, indexing, extraction, retrieval, chat/advisor usage, and enterprise deployment/governance requirements.

It also mirrors how adjacent products package value:

* Cursor combines plan access with usage concepts and enterprise packaging.
* LangSmith has paid plans that scale with usage volume rather than only seats.
* Polar supports fixed subscription products plus metered pricing and usage billing, which fits our desired model well.

---

## Context

From our current stack and privacy model, ctxpipe cost/value is driven by:

* ingestion from Git and Git-connected sources
* normalisation into a common ingestion pipeline
* indexing and graph extraction
* storage and sync/re-sync
* retrieval and advisor/chat flows
* LLM routing via OpenRouter
* enterprise trust requirements around hosting, retention, governance, and org isolation

This means **pure seat pricing is probably the wrong primary model**.

Instead, the external pricing model should likely be based on:

* **connected sources**
* **included monthly context operations**
* optional **enterprise deployment/governance add-ons**

“Context operations” is the blended public meter that hides internal complexity like retrieval, extraction, graph expansion, and model calls.

---

## Proposed pricing model

### Public pricing shape

| Plan | Who it’s for | Monthly price (USD) | Included sources | Included context ops / month | Hosting | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Sandbox | solo builders / eval | Free | 2 | 2,000 | Hosted | low-friction trial |
| Starter | small teams | 299 | 10 | 25,000 | Hosted | first real team plan |
| Team | growing eng orgs | 999 | 30 | 100,000 | Hosted | shared team usage |
| Scale | deeper adoption | 2,500 | 100 | 300,000 | Hosted / private cloud | better controls + volume |
| Enterprise | large / secure orgs | Custom | Custom | Custom | VPC / self-hosted / hosted | security, governance, rollout |

### Suggested overages / add-ons

| Meter | Suggested pricing |
| -- | -- |
| Additional connected source | $15/source/month |
| Additional 10,000 context ops | $40 |
| Private cloud add-on | from $1,000/month |
| Self-hosted minimum | from $30k–$75k ARR |

---

## Product/pricing principles

1. **Do not anchor pricing around seats**
   * seats can exist in packaging, but should not be the primary value metric
2. **Do not expose raw tokens as the commercial model**
   * customers want to buy reliable context infrastructure, not model bills
3. **Primary external metric should be simple**
   * recommended: **connected sources + monthly context ops**
4. **Enterprise tier is essential**
   * this is where private deployment, SSO, governance, retention controls, support, and custom integrations live

---

## Polar implementation direction

Use **Polar subscriptions + metered pricing**.

Recommended structure:

### Product structure

* Create one subscription product per plan:
  * Sandbox
  * Starter
  * Team
  * Scale
  * Enterprise (likely sales-led / manual)

### Fixed recurring component

* Each paid tier has a monthly recurring subscription price

### Metered component

* Add a metered price for **context operations**
* Optionally add a second meter later for **connected sources beyond included allowance**

Polar supports:

* subscription products
* metered prices on subscription products
* ingestion of usage events
* monthly or yearly usage aggregation/invoicing
* credits/prepaid usage patterns if we later want included allowances to behave as credits

### Recommended billing logic

* include a monthly allowance of context ops per plan
* record usage events from app/backend
* invoice overages monthly
* keep the public model simple even if internal cost attribution is more complex

---

## What needs to be built

### 1\. Pricing page

Create a pricing page for ctxpipe with:

* plan cards
* monthly pricing
* source allowances
* context ops allowances
* enterprise CTA
* short explanation of what a “context op” means
* FAQ section explaining why pricing is based on org infrastructure rather than seats

### 2\. Polar billing integration

Implement billing model in Polar:

* recurring subscription products
* metered billing for context ops
* checkout / subscription flow
* webhook handling for subscription state changes
* webhook/event ingestion for usage events
* customer billing visibility in app if practical

### 3\. Internal meter definition

Define exactly what counts as a billable **context op**.
Initial recommendation:

* retrieval/query against indexed knowledge
* chat/advisor request with retrieval
* graph expansion or context assembly step
* bounded ingestion extraction pass

This can be blended internally as one meter even if multiple backend operations contribute.

---

## Deliverables

* pricing page implemented
* Polar products/plans configured
* metered billing pipeline connected
* usage event schema defined
* first-pass FAQ and pricing copy added
* docs/comments in code explaining pricing assumptions

---

## Acceptance criteria

* user can view pricing page with the 5-tier structure above
* user can subscribe to a paid plan through Polar
* paid plans have recurring billing configured
* backend can send usage events for context ops
* usage over included allowance is metered
* enterprise plan has contact-sales path
* pricing copy clearly positions ctxpipe as an **organisation-level context layer for engineering agents**

---

## Notes for implementation

* keep first release simple; avoid too many public meters
* it is okay for the public model to expose only:
  * connected sources
  * context ops
* internally we can still map costs to:
  * ingestion
  * extraction
  * retrieval
  * storage
  * model routing
  * observability

@jakub / @vietanhtran.dev [https://github.com/ctxpipe-ai/payments](<https://github.com/ctxpipe-ai/payments>)

No work done on the app-side to hook into the payments system. Need some guidance here on direction.

Hey @jakub  - this is one big-ass summary of research I've been doing. Let's discuss it and see where we land. I'd like to use Polar, but open to anything.
